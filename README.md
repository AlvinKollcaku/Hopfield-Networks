## Overview

The goal of this project is to test and compare the performance of different types of Hopfield Networks using the MNIST dataset.

## Methods Under Evaluation

1. **Traditional Hopfield Network** using Hebbian learning  
2. **Dense Associative Memory (DAM)**  
3. **Continuous Hopfield Network** from the paper *["Hopfield Networks is All You Need"](https://arxiv.org/abs/2008.02217)*

## Status

ðŸš§ Work in progress
